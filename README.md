##AdminPanel Info
AdminPanel was a project started after owning a community and my admins not knowing fully how to use database admin tools, so I created a very user friendly panel instead!

The panel also has access to Rcon, meaning your server can be maintained and run without the need to be in-game or even your computer!
<p align="center">
The panel by default comes with 8 levels 
1: View Only. 2: View and Add Notes. 3: View and Kick Players. 
4: View and Ban Players. 5: Edit Cop level and Blacklist status. 
6: Edit Cop/Medic level and Blacklist status. 
7: Edit all values apart from staff and settings. 
8: Global.

Donations are much appreciated!
