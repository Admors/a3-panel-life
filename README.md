##AdminPanel Info
AdminPanel was a project started after owning a community and my admins not knowing fully how to use database admin tools, so I created a very user friendly panel instead!

The panel also has access to Rcon, meaning your server can be maintained and run without the need to be in-game or even your computer!

##PRE 2.5.0 UPDATE
<p align="center">

The panel by default comes with 8 levels 
1: View Only. 2: View and Add Notes. 3: View and Kick Players. 
4: View and Ban Players. 5: Edit Cop level and Blacklist status. 
6: Edit Cop/Medic level and Blacklist status. 
7: Edit all values apart from staff and settings. 
8: Global.

##POST 2.5.0 UPDATE

###Install

Just drop these files into a webserver (make sure they are in the root directory of where you are dropping them etc - public_html or the folder for you subdomain else the page linking may have issues.). Everything else is configured from the panel itself so no need for file configuration!
