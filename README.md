##AdminPanel Info
AdminPanel was a project started after owning a community and my admins not knowing fully how to use database admin tools, so I created a very user friendly panel instead!

The panel also has access to Rcon, meaning your server can be maintained and run without the need to be in-game or even your computer!
<p align="center">
The panel by default comes with 8 levels 
1: View Only. 2: View and Add Notes. 3: View and Kick Players. 
4: View and Ban Players. 5: Edit Cop level and Blacklist status. 
6: Edit Cop/Medic level and Blacklist status. 
7: Edit all values apart from staff and settings. 
8: Global.

###Download

Download the latest version from <a href = "https://github.com/Jason2605/AdminPanel/releases">here!</a>

###Install

Just drop these files into a webserver (make sure they are in the root directory of where you are dropping them etc - public_html or the folder for you subdomain else the page linking may have issues.). Everything else is configured from the panel itself so no need for file configuration!

Thanks for the support!
